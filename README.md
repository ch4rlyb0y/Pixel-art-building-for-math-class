Basically build a pixel art in Calc by using template or perler beads from the source of your choice then apply the first macro to create a color dictionnary on a selection keeping in mind what a studend might have as colors.
Apply the first macro an a row having a sample of all the colors used to create your dictionnary.
Past that dictionnary in the second macro.
Add the coordinates using the given formula in all the cells of your art in Calc.
Select a sector an used the second macro to have something you can export in a writer file (see templates provided).
Select what you obtained in "Regroupement"
Put your cursor in A2 in the corresponding table in Writer and used the third macro.
Repeat for each sector.
Puting a shortcut on most used Macros get you even faster.
